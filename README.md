# FedMart - A federated marketplace toolkit for integration of microservice based shops

Imagine a scenario where independent online shops can come together, forming a united front, sharing resources, and expanding their reach. That's precisely what FedMart offers. It's a unique digital toolkit designed to knit online shops into a collaborative federation, expanding their potential manifold.

## Key Components of FedMart:

- **Federation Hub:** This is the heart of FedMart. While it operates as a central coordination point, facilitating shops to join the federation, its design allows for replication. This means that new, decentralized federations can emerge, furthering the decentralized ethos of the marketplace.

- **Federation Service:** Think of this as the bridge that connects individual shops to the larger federation. It's a microservice that's effortlessly integrated into a shop's existing system, enabling it to seamlessly communicate with the Hub and other federated shops.

- **Inventory Exchange Service:** This isn't just an API. It's the blueprint of our unique protocol, allowing shops to not just exchange inventories, but also user data, metrics, and much more. It sets the standard for inter-shop communication in the federation.
